# Burgertime CPU-7 module

This is a 1-for-1 reproduction of the Burgertime CPU-7 module which came
encapsulated in epoxy.

The layout and routing is as close to original as possible.

The original board has a wire running from pin 10 of IC3 to a pad on the
lower left corner, and then to the ground plane of the main PCB stack. This
reproduction may work without it, but it is best to add it like on the
original.

Pictures of the original board and a PDF schematic are available in the
docs directory. The gerbers for JLCPCB are in the zip file in the gerbers
directory.

Change history:  
1.0 - Initial version  
1.1 - Updated to add component values, gerbers, and docs.  

To Do:
